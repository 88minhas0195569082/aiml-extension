## Introduction

Silicon Labs natively supports TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers (TFLM) as an AIML extension for SiSDK. TensorFlow is one of the most widely used neural network development platforms. Silicon Labs also supports other Machine Learning (ML) methods through the use of third-party software tools and solutions.

## EFR32 Platform

The EFR32 platform from Silicon Labs is an ultra-low-power System-on-Chip (SoC) with integrated Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) 5.4. It is designed for IoT wireless devices that require long battery life. Tensorflow lite integrates our AI Co-processor to perform AIML workloads. EFR platform is a widely used AI/ML enabled platform from Silicon Labs which can used for range IoT enabled AI/ML applications.

> **_NOTE:_**
> The current release is considered **_alpha_** quality.
